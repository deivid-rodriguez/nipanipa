# This configuration was generated by

# on 2016-11-06 09:38:20 -0200 using RuboCop version 0.45.0.
# The point is for the user to remove these configuration records
# one by one as the offenses are removed from the code base.
# Note that changes in the inspected code, or installation of new
# versions of RuboCop, may require this file to be generated again.

# Offense count: 5
# Configuration parameters: CountComments.
#
# @todo The default (25) is virtually impossible to achieve on a standard Rails
# app, where configuration blocks are heavily used. Decide on a better default
# and move this to .rubocop.yml
